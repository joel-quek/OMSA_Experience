# GaTech OMSA
## The Origin Story
It was a warm summer evening, circa 2022 A.D., when my friend (hereafter referred to a *Jpsilon*) turned to me and asked, *"Bro, have you ever thought about pursuing a Master's in Data Science?"* Without a moment's pause, I replied, *"Yes."*

Two years later, that simple word unfolded into an unforgettable journey—one that saw exactly **one** of us cross the finish line.

## My Background
I graduated from NUS with a BSc in Mathematics. During my undergrad, I also studied coding (C, MATLAB etc) and dabbled in Python as a working adult. So, while my module ratings are rooted in a STEM background, they might not reflect the experiences of someone with a different academic history.

## The Plot Twist
After submitting my application to the OMSA program, I discovered that my Georgia Tech journey wouldn’t officially begin until Fall 2023. Then, on a chilly evening in 2022, Jpsilon suggested an idea: why not get a head start by taking some of the modules on EdX? The added bonus of potentially earning Advanced Standing credits was a chance too good to pass up. Needless to say, I signed up for the EdX modules while he supported me from a distance, like [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nQw03QkTPU) from Hobbs & Shaw.

## The Rating Rubric
I will be rating modules based on two criteria
- **Difficulty**:
  
  How challenging the material is and how much effort (or pain) you should be prepared for.
- **Relevance**:
  
  How practical or valuable I found the module in real-world scenarios.

I will also share what the grading components are. All GaTech modules contain a combination of the following:

- Homework
- Examinations
- Project(s)

I will also share my grades - because finishing quickly wouldn’t mean much if the results didn’t hold up.
I have the same GPA as [Charles Spencer in Captain America Civil War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmjRhmk800U)

## Spring 2023 [3 Credit Hours]

### ISYE6501 Introduction to Analytics Modelling (EdX)

*Difficulty: 3/10*

*Relevance: 7/10*

*Module Components: Homework and Exams*

*Grade: A (Advanced Standing Modules are ungraded)*

The lecture videos were well-produced, and the lecturer, Joel Sokol, is a phenomenal teacher. Expect to cover a wide range of machine learning algorithms and formulas. The homework assignments introduced me to R coding for the first time, which was a valuable learning experience. The lectures provide simple proof sketches for each formula (e.g., the SVM formula), which may give students the impression that the proofs will be tested. However, the exams were multiple-choice and focused on understanding the uses of different models, rather than detailed mathematical proofs. This was the first time in my life where a math exam didn't require any written work and was entirely multiple-choice. Overall, it's an excellent introduction to understanding various machine learning models, their use cases, and serves as a kind of "menu" showing what the OMSA program has to offer students. Dr. Sokol, if you're reading this and ever visit Singapore, let me buy you a meal.

For those who are wondering, here is _The Menu_

#### Basic Machine Learning
- Classification Models: SVM and KNN
- Clustering Models: K-means

#### Time-Series Models
- CUSUM
- Exponential Smoothing
- ARIMA
- GARCH

#### Regression Models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Advanced Regression

#### Tree-Based Methods
- CART
- Random Forest

#### Design of Experiments
- A/B Testing
- Factorial Design
- Multi-Armed Bandit Models

#### Probability-based Models
- Distribution Fitting
- Queuing
- Markov Chains
- Simulation

#### Optimization Models
- Prescriptive Statistics
- Statistical Modelling

#### Advanced Topics
- Non-parametric Models
- Graph Analysis
- Competitive Models
- Deep Learning

Side note: Jpsilon asked me a lot of questions regarding this module, and I finally understood how Sheldon Cooper felt when [teaching Penny Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5_ccmHk_TY).

## Summer 2023 [3 Credit Hours]
### MGT6203 Data Analytics for Business (EdX)

*Difficulty: 4/10*

*Relevance: 8/10*

*Module Components: Homework, Exams and Project*

*Grade: A (Advanced Standing Modules are ungraded)*

This course focused more on data than business and introduced students to data transformations like log-log and log-linear transformations. There are some interesting and practical concepts to learn, such as understanding the math behind stock alpha and beta values, basic queuing problems, and statistical forecasting. The homework assignments require the use of R, and the exams are also multiple-choice. In my honest opinion, the exam for this module involved more calculations than ISYE 6501.

The course also includes a large project component, where I had the pleasure of working with a stellar group of teammates, especially my best teammate, WS, with whom I went on to collaborate on many projects. I would bring WS to Vormir and [collect the Soul Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtyWRviYp0o). (Note: the relevance rating I'm giving is largely due to the project we worked on.) We performed extensive feature engineering and data cleaning for the project. The project itself is very open-ended, so get creative! My team did an excellent job.

## Fall 2023 [3 Credit Hours]
### CSE6040 Computing for Data Analysis

*Difficulty: 7/10*

*Relevance: 10/10*

*Module Components: Homework and Exams*

*Grade: A*

This module was very well-designed, and the lecturer is excellent. To be honest, I only watched the first lecture, but I found him engaging, and the content was presented very effectively. The homework introduces students to the Vocareum platform, where every coding assignment requires unit tests to score points, giving you immediate feedback. You can also check your output to see exactly where you went wrong and debug accordingly. There are 15 homework assignments, which means you'll be busy every week.

The examinations for this course should not be taken lightly. They are proctored coding tests, and you cannot receive help from humans or AI. This is a great challenge for those who rely heavily on tools like ChatGPT or Co-Pilot for coding. The exams simulate real coding tests used in job interviews and cover everything from cleaning large datasets to developing complex Python dictionaries, SQL wrangling, REGEX, and more. Do not underestimate them—they will humble you, just as they did my friend.

Skills that will be tested:

*Mathematical Preliminaries*: Basics of probability, calculus, and linear algebra.

*Python Programming*: A review of Python, particularly for data manipulation.

*Data Representation*: Techniques for handling unstructured data, such as strings, and regular expressions.

*Data Preprocessing and Visualization*: Methods for transforming and visualizing data for analysis.

*Algorithms*: An introduction to pairwise association mining and working with different data structures.

The course was very well designed. Thank you Dr. Vuduc. Sorry I did not watch all your lectures, I have ADHD.

## Spring 2024 [6 Credit Hours]
### MGT8803 Business Fundamentals for Analytics

*Difficulty: ?/10*

*Relevance: ?/10*

*Module Components: Exams and a Supply Chain Simulation*

*Grade: C*

I didn't engage with the lecture materials or dedicate any time to studying for the exams (hence I did not rate this module). The course primarily focused on business theories, which didn't align with my personal interests. Consequently, I chose to take the exams without studying, allowing me to concentrate on other stuff in my life - like saving my friend's undergraduate honour's thesis ([BCheah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU0VlqkCDk8&list=PLbOSqJKglMt1pcfTh6QNOnML7BUeZ8LZ4&index=3) I'm talking about you).

In this course, four key areas are tested: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain. Each topic was assessed through a multiple-choice exam.

Additionally, I am still curious about the necessity of purchasing the Harvard Supply Chain Simulation for the course. 

### ISYE6644 Simulation and Modelling for Engineering and Science

*Difficulty: 7/10*

*Relevance: 8/10*

*Module Components: Homework, Exams, Project*

*Grade: A*

I will summarize this module in my own words:

_Primer on Basic Calculus and Probability Theory_

This section introduces students to double integration, summation notation, and basic modular arithmetic. It also covers discrete and continuous random variables and how to perform arithmetic on variance and expectation. This can be quite challenging for those without a foundation in calculus or probability theory.

_Using Arena and Excel to Run Simulations_

Why use Arena when Python can run better simulations?

_Random Number Generation_

This section focuses a lot on modular arithmetic and prime number theories. While random number generation is crucial for generating pseudo-random data points in simulations, it can be a bit abstract. You’ll be introduced to various Pseudo-Random Number (PRN) generators, including Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs) and the professor's favorite Desert Island Generator, which subtly uses Fermat's Theorem. Things get more complex when the professor introduces Tausworthe Generators, combining summation notation with modular arithmetic. This section is heavily tested.

_Random Variate Generation_

In this chapter, you’ll encounter two very important theorems: the Inverse Transform Theorem and LOTUS. You’ll learn how to generate various continuous random variables from the Uniform Distribution to create large simulation models. Expect to become familiar with Triangular, Weibull, Poisson, Normal distributions, and see how convolutions of these functions can generate new random variables. You’ll also learn the Acceptance-Rejection Method for generating random variables and study the formalized version of Brownian Motion.

_Input and Output Analysis_

Students will learn to define unbiased estimators and use capital pi notation to calculate Maximum Likelihood Estimates.

_Comparing Systems_

Students will learn to compute the Confidence Intervals of Means to pompare two different systems. They will also learn paried t-tests and differences of means.

In summary: Random number generation creates the base data for simulations. Random variate generation transforms these numbers into meaningful variables based on real-world distributions. Input and output analysis ensures the data used and the results produced are accurate, helping make valid predictions and informed decisions from the simulation.

The homework assignments were multiple-choice, but most of the questions (except for ARENA) required calculations. Some of these calculations were quite lengthy. I had to teach my groupmates how to approach the homework problems because they were fairly challenging. Here is an example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d646826c-5db3-44b1-9637-aec8f509cfa5)



The group project makes up a large portion of the grade, with project topics decided by the course instructors. I teamed up with WS again, along with two other guys who didn't pull their weight. One member left our group after the first meeting, and another disappeared midway through. WS and I were left to face the challenge together, I could fight Thanos with WS.

The exams are very similar to Homework questions. I personally felt that the ARENA questions were not well designed, why do I need to know this?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe59c2a2-4518-4802-8788-c8baa63c5f96)


Apart from the ARENA questions, please know that the questions are HEAVY on Mathematics, and really test your understanding of Calculus, Probability, summation/capital pi notation and Modular Arithmetic. If you do not have any strong background in these topics, you need to prepare yourself.

## An Interlude
After Spring 2024, I realized that I had five modules and the Practicum left. It was possible for me to finish the OMSA within the year. However, there was one problem—DVA cannot be taken during the Summer, and you need to have cleared DVA before you are allowed to take the Practicum. You’re not allowed to do both concurrently. So, I [emailed Georgia Tech](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics/student-resources) and appealed for permission to take both DVA and Practicum in the same semester. After a few back-and-forth emails, they granted my request. Thank you, GaTech Academic Team.

Also, in Summer 2024, I decided to do what everyone advised against—taking three modules in a single semester. I had to appeal for permission to do so as well. 

The Georgia Tech Academic Support team is **spectacular**. They never failed to answer my questions.

## Summer 2024 [9 Credit Hours]
### CS6750 Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

*Difficulty: 9/10*

*Relevance: 8/10*

*Module Components: Homework, Quizzes, Exams, Projects*

*Grade: A*

This module is a beast. I took it thinking it would be a "break" from coding, but boy, was I wrong. There’s no coding, but a ton of readings.

There are four quizzes, two tests, four homework assignments, and two projects. Sounds simple, right? No, let me tell you, the assignments aren’t a walk in the park. You’re expected to write essays based on the readings Dr. Joyner provides, and each reading can be at least 20 pages long. Each essay is a minimum of 600 words, and you’ll be cranking them out during quizzes and exams, all under time pressure.

And the projects? No different. HCI is all about designing UI for apps, and that means going through the entire needfinding process. You’ll need to survey and interview people before and after they use your product. So, while this module has no coding, don’t be fooled. You’ll spend a lot of time reading, researching, testing, and surveying/interviewing with people.

I had a solid project team, though without WS, but we knocked out a perfect project. 

### CS7646 Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T)

*Difficulty: 10/10*

*Relevance: 10/10*

*Module Components: Homework*

*Grade: C*

Students gain hands-on experience by coding in Python, building trading strategies, and working with real market data. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to applying machine learning methods to financial modeling, and some assignments challenge students to implement complex algorithms and refine their trading strategies. Expect a mix of coding, report writing, and testing different models on market data.

This module is another beast by Dr Joyner. What a legendary module. There are no exams or projects, but 8 very well-designed coding assignments that are interconnected:

*Project 1 Martingale*: 

Analyzing the Martingale betting strategy for risk management.

*Project 2 Optimize Portfolio*: 

Using optimization techniques to find the best portfolio allocation.

*Project 3 Decision Trees and Ensembles*: 

Implementing decision tree learners, random trees, and ensemble methods for classification tasks.

*Project 4 Regression Models*: 

Creating data sets suitable for linear regression and decision trees, and assessing model performance.

*Project 5 Market Simulation*: 

Developing a market simulation to calculate portfolio metrics based on trade data.

*Project 6 Manual Strategy*: 

Designing a simple trading strategy with higher returns than a benchmark.

*Project 7 Q-Learning Robot*: 

Implementing Q-learning in a robot navigation scenario, applying reinforcement learning.

*Project 8 Strategy Learner*: 

Framing the trading problem using machine learning methods from previous assignments (like Q-learning or ensemble models).

Dr Joyner's modules are the hardest but most well designed. The man is an *ARTIST*. 

### ISYE6740 Computational Data Analysis (CDA)

*Difficulty: 5/10*

*Relevance: 8/10*

*Module Components: Homework and Project*

*Grade: A*

This module is *MATH HEAVY*.

The course covers important topics such as:

- Asymptotic analysis of machine learning methods
- Objective functions and how to determine the right ones
- Methods for assessing model errors
- Theoretical aspects of machine learning, including statistical rigor
- Practical applications of algorithms in real-world datasets

Every homework assignment comes in two parts:
1. Mathematical Proof of the machine learning method
2. Code involving the machine learning method

Here is a snippet from one of my homework reports

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d92ac1fc-2e89-4792-95a2-a98f58aeb34b)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e277c20c-9374-482a-890f-2a43f77f356f)


The project was really a free-for-all. You could choose to do it in teams of one to four, hence I opted to do it alone. I did a project involving the [NASA Degradation Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps), and really had a chance to apply the Q-Learning algorithm from ML4T. The project was well-received.

CDA made me think deeply about each algorithm and properly savour every proof and understand how they are mathematically derived. Through this course, I was able to gain a better understanding of the Gradient Descent Algorithm, and was able to co-publish [a paper](https://atcm.mathandtech.org/EP2024/abstracts.html#22173) with my Professor, Dr Ho Weng Kin, during Summer 2024. Dr Ho is like [Master Yoda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxCR2bFWHxM).

I've done a couple triathlons in my life, but Summer 2024 was an academic triathlon that almost *broke me*.

Swim: ML4T
Always the worst, no one can be fully prepared for open water swims - the waves, getting kicked in the face or needing to pee on the move.

Bike: HCI
Easy if there are no hills, and you know this is the longest distance of the three. Pelotons in triathlons are the worst because other cyclists have poor overtaking etiquette.

Run: CDA
What I am good at and I experience flow while doing. Always my favourite of the three.

## A Resolution

One would think I'd be crazy to repeat my mistake of taking three modules in a semester. Summer 24 almost broke me and I was about to test my limits even further by taking DVA, HDDA and Practicum in the same semester - three modules known to be extremely difficult to complete even on their own.

But I was set on completing OMSA in 2024. If Hawkeye could survive all those world-ending events with a bow, maybe I have a shot.

## Fall 2024 [12 Credit Hours]
### CSE6242 Data and Visual Analytics (DVA)

*Difficulty: 99999/10*

*Relevance: 10/10*

*Module Components: Homework and Project*

*Grade: A*

DVA is the **hardest** module in OMSA in my opinion. I would like to point out that DVA is more of a *SOFTWARE ENGINEERING* module than a data science module.

There are four homework assignments in this course—yes, only four. Each homework comes with a generous three-week deadline. Initially, I thought, "Wah, so much time ah?" No, bro. These homework assignments are from another realm.

*Homework 1 (10%):*

Focuses on foundational tasks like collecting and visualizing data, working with SQLite, and warming up with D3.js and OpenRefine. You better take the D3 warmup *seriously*.

*Homework 2 (15%):*

Emphasizes building complex D3.js visualizations and graphs. This assignment often includes bonus opportunities for additional points. I almost failed this homework assignment. It was a *masssacre*.

*Homework 3 (15%):*

Covers big data processing using tools like Apache Spark, Docker, and cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. 10/10 on the usefulness scale.

*Homework 4 (10%):*

Combines theoretical and practical machine learning techniques. This includes implementing PageRank and building a Random Forest Classifier using Python and Scikit-learn. Yes, you have to code a Random Forest algorithm from scratch, and you cannot hide behind Python libraries.

The homework assignments are *brutal*, Homework 2 gave me many sleepless nights and endless frustrations. I have a lot of respect for software engineers who code with javascript and React. Homework 3 forced students to use the various cloud computing providers like AWS, Docker, Spark etc. Difficult? Yes. Useful? Immensely. No one in their right mind would put themselves through so much pain willingly, unless you are forced. 

The project required groups of 4 minimum. Initially I thought to myself, "Why can't I just do with WS, like in Simulation?" Once again, DVA proved me wrong. We had a group of 5 and we never stopped working. The project was free-for-all, we could choose any topic we wanted. We decided to build a model which predicted flight delays based on parameters like country of departure, time of the year, season, mileage etc, and we also built a Google Plug-In and website for end-users to key in their travel details and receive real-time updates on their flight delays. We spent days running our models, performing feature engineering, generating feature importance, optimising our models and repeating the machine learning cycle up till the dat of submission. Not for the faint hearted. Thankfully, our project was very well received. 

This course is the most brutal course in OMSA, but the skills acquired are immensely useful. I was half prepared to get a D for this module. It is compulsory anyway, all the best to whoever is about to take this module.

### ISYE8803 Topics on High Dimensional Data Analytics

*Difficulty: 5/10*

*Relevance: 10/10*

*Module Components: Homework and Exams*

*Grade: A*

HDDA is basically CDA on crack. 

Before I talk about the assignments, I will explain why HDDA is important, using jargon-free language.

HDDA is important because it helps us make sense of extremely complex data, which is increasingly common in many fields today. When datasets have a huge number of variables—like hundreds of features in a machine learning model or genetic data in bioinformatics—traditional methods often fail or become inefficient. HDDA techniques are designed to handle such data effectively, focusing on:

*Finding What Matters:* 

In large datasets, many features may be irrelevant or redundant. HDDA identifies which variables are meaningful, simplifying the data without losing critical information.

*Avoiding Overfitting:* 

With too many variables and not enough observations, models can become overly specific to the training data. HDDA helps create generalized models that perform well on unseen data.

*Improving Predictions:* 

By focusing on the most important features and patterns, HDDA makes predictive models more accurate, which is valuable for engineers in designing systems or predicting performance.

*Saving Resources:* 

Processing high-dimensional data directly can be time-consuming and costly. HDDA reduces complexity, making it faster and more feasible to analyze data.

Here are some concepts required for the assignments

*Functional Data Analysis:*

Techniques for analyzing data functions over a continuum (e.g., time series or spatial data).

*Image Processing and Analysis:*

Methods to process and extract meaningful information from image data.

*Regularization in High-Dimensional Regression:*

Strategies like Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, and sparsity-inducing norms to handle overfitting and select features.

*Multilinear Algebra and Tensor Analysis:*

Decompositions and methods for dimensionality reduction in tensor data (e.g., CP decomposition, Tucker decomposition).

*Optimization Techniques:*

Gradient descent, stochastic methods, and convex optimization for efficient algorithm development.

*Applications in Machine Learning:*

Methods to apply learned techniques in various real-world scenarios, particularly where data is high-dimensional or sparse.

The homework assignments follow the same format as CDA homework assignments, where students are required to submit 
1. Mathematical Proof of the machine learning method
2. Code involving the machine learning method

Here is a snippet of a HDDA Homework report

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e27150f-2cb0-456f-857e-bed45e481ff9)


The exams are take-home and open internet. They are basically the same as every HDDA homework assignment, but with a shorter deadline and higher weightage. If you ask me, I would say that the difficulty of the exam questions are no different from the homework. It's just that you have less time to work on them.

Here is a snippet of what HDDA Exam Questions look like

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec0e128-fb93-443d-9ce5-9b9ab1a193bc)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc21591-0fa8-4e08-9041-db09c052597f)


HDDA is a stellar course and very well designed. It is very math heavy and not for the faint hearted.


### CSE6748 Applied Analytics Practicum

*Difficulty: 10/10*

*Relevance: 10/10*

*Module Components: One semester-long Project*

*Grade: A*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2eb2aa1-ada1-403c-bba7-3fb49d5e3f33)


I had the privilege of completing my Practicum with Michelin North America. Technically you can approach your own company and propose a project to GaTech, or you can go with the list of companies that are partnered with the University. This also means that the Practicum can be as easy or challenging as you want it to be. What I love about Practicum is that it’s designed to simulate real-world working conditions. My team of three had to coordinate across different time zones, squeezing in meetings whenever we could. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement, I can’t share specific details about the project, but Michelin makes tyres and hands out stars to chefs, so you can draw your own conclusions. Side note, I think [One Fattened Calf](https://www.onefattenedcalf.com/) in Singapore deserves at least *one* star.

The Practicum was a beast - we spent *weeks* on feature engineering and data cleaning alone. We spent a lot of time finding key features to make our model predictors leaner, and also searching for outliers that were skewing the data. It sounds simple, but imagine the dataset is larger than 20GB, and my computer can't even play Valorant without glitching.

At this juncture, let me take a moment to share my take on what defines a **true data scientist**. It’s not about being someone who writes code to run a random forest model for 12 hours — anyone with enough patience can do that. A real data scientist is someone who can look at raw data and do two critical things:

1. Clean the data:

This means identifying and removing outliers, normalizing variables, applying one-hot encoding, and performing accurate imputation to handle missing values.

2. Feature Engineering:

This involves thinking creatively and transforming existing predictors into new features that significantly boost model performance.

At Michelin, we quickly realized that they had far more powerful supercomputers than my humble ASUS laptop. Their systems could probably run random forest algorithms in under an hour. What they really needed from us wasn’t brute-force computing power — they needed creativity and ingenuity to transform their data into actionable insights. That’s the true value a data scientist brings to the table: solving problems by rethinking the data, not just running the code. Something only a creative human mind can achieve, not ChatGPT.

## Final Thoughts

The rigour of Fall 2024 was on a whole different level compared to Summer 2024, so I’m still surprised I managed to do better in my final semester — especially since Summer almost broke me. Maybe it was that final push where I gave it everything I had, like the final 10km of a marathon.

Clearing 7 modules plus Practicum in 2024 was *mentally exhausting*, thankfully I was able to hide how mentally shag I was from others. Could I have done better if I only took 2 modules per semester? I guess we'll never know. 

Regardless, I would highly recommend OMSA to anyone who wants to attain a deeper understanding of Data Science. OMSA is an affordable course with a very flexible schedule and the instruction and content are **fantastic**. Don't take the easy way out - approach OMSA with a growth mindset and take the harder modules, because those are usually the ones where you can learn more from. Could someone take easier modules and graduate with a 3.8 GPA? Of course, but the point is to *learn*, otherwise you are just purchasing a piece of paper. 

Finally, here are two things I have yet to receive in 2024
1. My GaTech t-shirt from both 2023 and 2024
2. My newcomers' lunch from my [home church](https://www.bukitarang.church/explorechristianity/lifes-big-questions/#:~:text=Life's%20Big%20Questions%20is%20an,a%20relaxed%20and%20accessible%20way.), which I've been attending for thirty years

Thank you.
